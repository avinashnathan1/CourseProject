A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you men But I just can't be the guy everybody depends On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair I will always be here, but that spark isn't there And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fighting for air I'm barely charting myself Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent To treat y'all like a stepping stone Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up But the longer we spend living this lie that we live The less is left for closure, so let's let this go It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over  I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From it I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may End up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

But maybe I was too nice My homie text me a picture, and I just burst into anger It was my girl - in a bed, with her personal trainer I text my homie like "Yo, where you find this?" He says "Snapchat bro. It's all on my timeline, shit." Swear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest I looked at my girl and said "Get a paternity test!" She said "NO! Don't you get all worked and upset - I only slept in the bed right after work just to rest." I said "What? You expect me to believe that? Ha, alright, yea, I'll 'relax' guess it doesn't seem bad, my girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged." Officer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached! I said "bitch, I can't believe this shit Does he know your pregnant? Is that his kid? Look how big my headache is This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit What type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick? I said, "Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kidding bitch." She said, "No - I'm not getting it!" Officer, I ain't seen her in months I couldn't trust the lying whore Plus she told me she slept with this guy before And then I said, y'know what? Forget it. S'all good Nevermind, shit was making my blood pressure high I love her unconditionally, you know? I can't pretend I ain't never lie For the moment, I guess I'll let it slide She said "If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus then say so" I said "Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go, how you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough." She said "Hahaha. I make loads." She had six grand cash I said "But you was broke two weeks ago! How you makin' chips that fast?" She said, "I bartend, I made it all in tips haha." I said, "Girl, you must take me as a big jackass." I'm like "Please, we both know money is hard to come by" Her bullshit, might fly over the heads of some guys Officer, she's always telling dumb lies I've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time! I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?" She said "I bartend, duhhh, from tips. I'm a waitress" I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?" She started stuttering like "uhm-uhh-mmm Marcus, wait just-" I said, "Where'd you get the cash from?" She said, "Ok, ok, I'll tell you just promise me you won't get mad." I'm like "Baby, where'd you get the cash from?" She said "I work at a strip club... It's how I made the six grand." I said "Woaah, no... NOOOOOO!" I fell down in tears, my heart broke, I turned cold I don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' hoe shit If she needed cash, I woulda loaned it, and she knows it They won't lemme get a refund on this $20,000 ring Fuck my head hurts, I need some ibuprofen  <i>[Officer:]</i> Yea, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute? <i>[Hopsin:]</i> Um, may I have some water please? <i>[Officer:]</i> Ah, no worries at all <i>[Hopsin:]</i> I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me <i>[Officer:]</i> Yea, it's alright, you're good...Yea, here ya go mate <i>[Hopsin:]</i> Thanks... <i>[*sips water*]</i> I wasn't me no more, I looked her in the eyes, and straight told her <i>[Officer:]</i> What'd you say to her?  <i>[Hopsin:]</i> I need you to tell me where this strip club is at Or this family we're about to have is over I said "Tell me where it's at?" She said "No." I said "You about to make me mad..." She said "So?" I said "Bitch, you better panic and run. The damage is done. You doin' this 4 months away from having my son. UGH." I told her I would always have her back I forgave her after all the careless acts I have one question, and she couldn't share the facts The strip club - How come she couldn't tell me where it's at? Who the fuck she fuckin' in there? Who's dick she suckin' in there? Shakin' her fuckin' butt in the air It's like we've argued for a thousand fucking hours I'm annoyed and I was at the point where something was about to get destroyed I grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room I fuckin' launched it too It was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels I blacked out She said "What the fuck is wrong with you?" She got up out the bed to get it - I pushed her ass back in it I said "We still talkin' bitch. You and I ain't finished. Nah. This strip club, where is it? BITCH WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?" I said "You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine." In the process of all this drama, I had lost my mind I felt lost and blind The gym trainer, the strip club The ring, the baby She really crossed the line And then I finally came down and all the madness was finished Then she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith I said "I ain't goin' with you, you can leave now, I need to stay in this hotel room, and figure some things out." Officer, I know you ain't gonna sympathize I don't approve of any man putting hands on his girlfriend or wife Especially when she's pregnant with his kid inside Honestly, feel like I wasn't in the wrong But still, I wasn't in the right Ask her she ain't got no bruises on her I'm human - there's only so much a dude can conquer She knew that her actions reflected true dishonor and tried to cover it Sayin' I'm and abusive monster that's bullshit, huh And that fast, poof, all of her wrongs are in the past cool She's just the innocent white girl and I'm the black guy Who always gets mad, true! I know y'all about to make it hard for me to get back into Australia - man this fucking shit is sad Dude, I still don't know if this baby is mine or not So when he's born, who's gonna be the fuckin' dad?

 It is a cold winter, Away is the songbird. And gone is her traveller, She waits at home.  The sun is on holiday, No leaves on the trees. The animals sleep While cold North wind blows.  The snowflakes are falling, The roof a white blanket. There's ice on the window pane, She waits alone.  She sits by the fireside, The room is so warm. Her children are sleeping, She waits in their home.  Passing the time. Passing the time, everything fine. Passing the time, having the wine. Passing the time, drinking red wine. Passing the time, drinking red wine. Passing the time, drinking red wine. Passing the time, everything fine. Passing the time, drinking red wine. Passing the time, everything fine. Passing the time, wine and time rhyme. Passing the time.  It is a long winter, Away is the summer. She waits for her traveller So far from home.  She sits by the fireside, The room is so warm. There's ice on the window, She's lonely alone. 
 When the city of Atlantis stood serene above the sea, Long time before our time when the world was free, Those were the days.  Golden cymbals flying on ocarina sounds, Before wild Medusa's serpents gave birth to hell Disguised as heaven.  Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days. Those were their ways, miracles everywhere, are they now? They're gone. Those were their ways, yes they were, those were their ways. Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.  Tie your painted shoes and dance, blue daylight in your hair, Overhead a noiseless eagle fans a flame. Wonder everywhere.  Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days. Those were their ways, miracles everywhere, are they now? They're gone. Those were their ways, yes they were, those were their ways. Those were the days, yes they were, those were the days.

I dream my life away.  I don't care if I get nowhere. I can just dream and you'll be there. What else is there to do?  Dreaming about my love; You bring me joy and hours of happiness, More or less.

Let's go back to where it's clean To see what year it might have been. The roads have carried off the smiles. As you said, To judge them at the trials.  Let's go back to now that's bad To see the time we might have had. The rails have carried off the trains. As you said, I'll never come again, again, again, again. 
 From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying. From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying. I believe to my soul that your daddy's Gulfport bound.  From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown. From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown. You know she won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.  A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers. A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through its drawers. She cause so many men to wear an apron overall.  When I leave this town I will bid you fair farewell. When I leave this town I will bid you fair farewell. And when I return again, you'll have a great long story to tell. 
 In the white room with black curtains near the station. Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings. Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes. Dawn-light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.  I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines; Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.  You said no strings could secure you at the station. Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows. I walked into such a sad time at the station. As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.  I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back; Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.  At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd. Consolation for the old wound now forgotten. Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes. She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.  I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd; Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.

 I see a pear falling down from the tree. Winter is coming and it's plain to see. I spend the cold nights in my lonely room. Is it the winter to which I am doomed?  Cold is the snow that will cover the ground. I feel the presence of tears falling down. Is it for pity or pain that I cry? Color is gone and the grass it must die.  Winter brings sadness that empties my soul. Life is too short for a dog growing old. He used to follow and play at my heels. Love from his heart I no longer can feel. 
 Hey, hey, mama; mama, what you tryin' to do? You keep on talkin' to me, 'till your face turns blue. Well, do you think I'm a young boy, yet to make up my mind? Well, I'm just castin' all my toys, I'm gonna' leave what's behind me, behind. I'm gonna' leave what's behind me, behind.  I saw an old high school friend, just the other day, He didn't ask me how I'd been, he asked me "how was my pay?" Now, do you call this a friendship, judging from what he said? If you do, I've a real tip: ain't nobody gonna' know about my bread. Ain't nobody gonna' know about my bread.  If you got somebody, that you can trust to the very end, I said if you do, I want to be like you, 'cause you sure got a real good friend. You sure got a real good friend. Friend ... Friend ... 
 Come on over to my side, it's where you wanna be Come on over to joy ride and let your morals be Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good time roll  Let me taste your life, let me fill your stream Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream Got this thing on the move, it's beginin' Got a strange kind of feeling under my skin  I hear my baby knockin' at my front door She knows what I got, she wants some more And when it's all over, I start to come down Think just a restin' place, I'll leave the ground 
 When I was feeling 'bout sixteen, I never had no idea. Listen to me if you want to know what I mean, your expression will let me see. I never knew what I was looking for, I never had the time. And now that time has opened up my door, now I'm looking forward just to see what, just what's mine.  When I was feeling 'bout eighteen, it's then when I began to see. No matter how hard you push on the door, it won't open without the key. Opportunity only knocks once, if you shut it out it's a sin. And when something keeps right on poundin', then, my friend, you'd better let it in.  Now I feel just a little bit old and, sadness fills my brain. I can flash to future years and nothing is the same. Nothing is the same. Nothing is the same. Nothing is the same.

 Revolution in their minds - the children start to march Against the world in which they have to live And all the hate that's in their hearts They're tired of being pushed around And told just what to do They'll fight the world until they've won And love comes flowing through  Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today Will the sunrise of tomorrow bringing peace in any way? Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear? Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?  So you children of the world Listen to what I say If you want a better place to live in Spread the word today Show the world that love is still alive You must be brave Or you children of today are Children of the Grave, Yeah! 
 A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears. The demons that you fought are feeding your fears. The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed. The truth destroys you, its no longer concealed.  Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing. In silence your violence has left my life in ruin. Yeah, in ruin, yeah.  You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul. Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole. Indoctrination by a twisted desire, The catechism of an evil messiah.  Dear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing. In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin. Yeah, in ruin, yeah.  Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy. Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy. You have taken my life, Now it's your turn to die.  Can you sleep at night? When you close your eyes Do you think of all the pain from your lies? Or do you deny you're responsible For the victims of the sins you devised?  What you gonna tell them when they ask you? Well then Is your conscience pure in your heart? There is no exemption when you seek redemption For all the lives that you've torn apart.  Your molestations of the cross you defiled, A man once holy now despised and reviled. You took possession while confessing my sins And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah.  Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing. In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah. In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah. In ruin yeah. 
 Alright now! Won't you listen?  When I first met you didn't realize I can't forget you for your surprise You introduced me to my mind And left me wanting you and your kind Oh yeah!

Come on now try it out  Straight people don't know what you're about They put you down and shut you out You gave to me a new belief And soon the world will love you sweet leaf Oh yeah baby 
 Born in a graveyard adopted by sin, I cultivate evil that's living within. A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul, Possessed by a demon that had full control.  The time it is coming when all life will end, With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend. Religion won't save me, the damage is done. The future has ended before it's begun.  Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day. Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray. God of the almighty never answers their call. Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him.  I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead. Pray not for the living I'll live in your head. Dying is easy it's living that's hard. I'm losing the battle between Satan and God. 
 Well people look and people stare Well I don't think that I even care You work your life away and what do they give? You're only killing yourself to live Killing yourself to live Killing yourself to live  Just take a look around you what do you see Pain, suffering, and misery It's not the way that the world was meant It's a pity you don't understand Killing yourself to live Killing yourself to live  I'm telling you Believe in me Nobody else will tell you Open your eyes And see the lies, oh yeah  You think I'm crazy and baby I know that it's true Before that you know it I think That you'll go crazy too  I don't know if I'm up or down Whether black is white or blue is brown The colors of my life are all different somehow Little boy blue's a big girl now  So you think it's me who's strange But you've never had to make the change Never give your trust away You'll end up paying till your dying day 
 He's just a loner He never says hello A friend to no one He's got no place to go  He don't look happy He look through furtive eyes He ain't got nothing No one to sympathize  Alright now  He hides himself away His secrets not revealed As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed  A solitary man An enigmatic child A riddle never solved A prisoner exiled  Alright now  I wonder if the loner can assimilate A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate  Come on yeah  Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside Someone on who he can depend It's getting too late to recover He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend  Don't descend <i>[x4]</i>  No understanding of things we already know He has to live his life and just learn how to let go  Communication's an impossibility His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead  Come on yeah 
 The epidemic from a crystal lie Puts you in super over drive The methademic that is so hard to hide Insanely staring with wide eyes  Hellucinating in a chemical Hell Ain't my idea of having fun Synthetic overload you're under its spell Your super nightmare's just begun  You try to stop, but it controls you Your love affair with it won't last You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction And in the end you're gonna crash  You live too fast You live too fast  You look just like a dead man alive Losing the fight for survival You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate Waiting the Devil's arrival Ha-Ha-Ha  You live so fast you need more methademic crystal You never sleep you just keep goin Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol Each time you're dying without knowing  You live too fast You live too fast  What's the point it's killing you without you even knowing I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going Ha-ha-ha I'll see you there 
 The world today is such a wicked place Fighting going on between the human race People got to work just to earn their bread While people just across the sea are counting their dead  A politician's job, they say, is very high For he has to choose who's got to go and die They can put a man on the moon quite easy While people here on earth are dying of old diseases  A woman goes to work every day after day She just goes to work just to earn her pay Child sitting crying by a life that's harder He doesn't even know who is his father 
 Do you hear the thunder Raging in the sky? Premonition of A shattered world that's gonna die.  In the Age of Reason, how do we survive? The protocols of evil Ravaging so many lives?  Mystifying silence Talking Peace on Earth. We should judge each other For ourselves not what we're worth.  Sustainable extinction, A fractured human race. A jaded revolution Disappears without a trace.  Always felt that there'd be trouble. Mass distraction hides the truth. Prozac days and sleepless hours. Seeds of change that don't bear fruit.  These time are heavy And you're all alone. The battle's over But the war goes on.  Politics, religion, Love of money too. It's what the world was built for But not for me and you. 
 I wish somebody would empty my head I am so sorry for the things that I've said This hopeless feeling that's living inside I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find Some peace of mind  I ain't no hero who's gonna save you I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride So please forgive me while I'm trying to find Some peace of mind  Read in between the lines Truth that is neither black nor white Black nor white Just give me something real Broken man still searching for the light In the night  Caught In the middle as the front line falls It looks like I don't stand a chance If only I could turn my life around Or is this just the circumstance

 Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose And two eyes made out of coal Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say He was made of snow but the children know How he came to life one day There must have been some magic in That old silk hat they found For when they placed it on his head He began to dance around Frosty the snowman Was alive as he could be And the children say he could laugh and play Just the same as you and me  Frosty the snowman Knew the sun was hot that day So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun Now before I melt away." Down to the village With a broomstick in his hand Running here and there and all around the square Saying "Catch me if you can" He led them down the streets of town Right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when He heard him holler "Stop!" Frosty the snowman Had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't you cry, I'll be back again someday" "I'll be back again someday" "I'll be back again someday"

 <i>[opening instrumental]</i>  I'll be seeing you in all the old, familiar places That this heart of mine embraces all day through In that small cafe, the park across the way The children's carousel, the chestnut tree, the wishing well  I'll be seeing you in ev'ry lovely summer's day In everything that's light and gay I'll always think of you that way I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you  <i>[instrumental-to end]</i>

 You see a pair of laughing eyes And suddenly your sighing sighs You're thinking nothing's wrong You string along, boy, then snap!  Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap  You're hand in hand beneath the trees And soon there's music in the breeze You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!  Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap  Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single  And all at once it seems so nice The folks are throwing shoes and rice You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map  You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap  Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single  And all at once it seems so nice The folks are throwing shoes and rice You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map  And then you wonder how it all came about It's too late now there's no gettin' out You fell in love, and love is the tender trap 
 The one I love belongs to somebody else She means her tender songs for somebody else And even when I have my arms around her I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else The hands I held belong to somebody else I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else It's tough to be alone on the shelf It's worse to fall in love by yourself The one I love belongs to somebody else The one I love belongs to somebody else 
 (Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights) dreamin' of a song The melody haunts my reverie and I am once again with you (When our love was new) and each kiss an inspiration Oh, but that was long ago, and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song  (And beside a garden wall, when the stars were bright) You were in my arms, the nightingale told its fairy tale of paradise where roses grew. Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain My stardust melody (the memory of love's refrain)  <i>[instrumental]</i>  Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain My stardust melody (the memory of love's refrain)  <i>[very brief instrumental]</i>  The memory (of love's refrain) 
 The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter The winds grow colder, suddenly you're a lot older And all because of a gal who got away No more her eager call, the writing is on the wall All those dreams you dreamed, they have all gone astray  The gal who won you, she's run off and undone you That great beginning has seen the final inning I don't know what happened, its all a crazy game No more - no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill And never a new love will ever be the same  Good riddance, good-bye Every trick of hers you are on to But fools will be fools and where's she gone? Where has she gone?  The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and it's tougher With hope ya burn up, tomorrow maybe she'll turn up There ain't no let up, live-long night, night and day  Ever since, since this world began There ain't nothin' sadder than A long-lost loser Lookin' for his gal who got away  Please come back Won't ya come back?  Mm, mm, mm Mm mmmm 
 Be careful, it's my heart, it's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart. It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burn, It's not a book I lent you that you never return.

 We've got nothin', got nothin' in common just nothin' in common My darling, at all  I love the opera, I detest the best pop Can't stand the opera, I like music that bops  We're not fated, not Heaven-created We're really mis-mated, our chances are small  Let's part, be real smart and not start with this romance 'Cause outside of both having stars in our eyes And outside of sighing the same kind of sighs We've got nothin' in common at all  We've got nothin', got nothin' in common just nothin' in common It never could last  I love Picasso, he's all style and he's all flair I've seen Picasso and I think he's a square  Our two goals are apart as the poles are As lovers our roles are completely miscast  Let's make a clean break and not take any chances 'Cause outside of thinking, you're something divine And outside of wanting your lips close to mine We've got nothin' in common We've got nothin' in common at all 
 Last night when we were young Love was a star, a song unsung Life was so new, so real so right Ages ago last night  Today the world is old You flew away and time grew cold Where is that star that shone so bright Ages ago last night?  To think that spring had depended On merely this: a look, a kiss To think that something so splendid Could slip away in one little daybreak  So now, let's reminisce And recollect the sighs and the kisses The arms that clung  When we were young last night 
 In the wee small hours of the morning, While the whole wide world is fast asleep, You lie awake and think about the girl And never, ever think of counting sheep.  When your lonely heart has learned its lesson, You'd be hers if only she would call, In the wee small hours of the morning, That's the time you miss her most of all.  <i>[Musical interlude]</i>  When your lonely heart has learned its lesson, You'd be hers if only she would call, In the wee small hours of the morning, That's the time you miss her most of all.

 It seems to me I've heard that song before It's from an old familiar score I know it well, that melody  It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream Dream that brought you so close to me  I know each word because I've heard that song before The lyrics said, "Forevermore" Forevermore's a memory  Please have them play it again And I'll remember just when I heard that lovely song before  It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream Dream that brought you so close to me  Please have them play it again And I'll remember just when I heard that lovely song before 
 I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair. The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air. The walls of my room fade away in the blue, And I'm deep in a dream of you.  The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend; You come to my arms, may this bliss never end, For we love anew just as we used to do When I'm deep in a dream of you.  Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing; We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again. My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start;  My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart. Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep Deep in a dream of you.

 It's just the same old song and dance The same old song and dance Turns out you never cared at all Turns out you bounced me like a ball  Whoever thought I'd fall For the same old song and dance It's just the same old smooth routine The same old moonlit scene  Turns out you only used those eyes Simply to sell me all those lies I really went king-size For the same old song and dance  Me with a built-in radar Me with a cushion hard Winding up number one On the all-time loser's chart  I should forget you but I won't Should hate you but I don't It didn't turn out like I planned But if you smiled and waved your hand  I'd go and hire a band And wait for one more chance At the same old song and dance  It didn't turn out just like I planned But if you smiled and waved your lily white hand I'd go out and hire a band Then wait for one more chance At the same old, same old song and dance 
 Soft as a raindrop, fresh as the sea Warm as the sunshine shining on me This was my love, this was my love  Light was her laughter, few were her tears Gentle her beauty, tender her years This was my love, this was my love  So young, so fair, such bright golden hair A smile always on her face No other love can ever compare No other can take her place  Others may cherish fortune or fame I will forever cherish her name For this was my love This was my love! 
 I took each word she said as gospel truth The way a silly little child would. I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, I was no babe in the wild, wild wood. She didn't mean it, I should have seen it, But now it's too late.  I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, Now it seems, This is how the story ends: She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, Not for long, I can see the way this ends: She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  Why should I care though she gave me the air, Why should I cry, Heave a sigh, And wonder why, And wonder why?  I thought I found the gal I could trust, Watta bust, this is how the story ends: She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be just friends?" 
 (I'll never smile again until I smile at you) (I'll never laugh again) What good would it do?  For tears would fill my eyes My heart would realize That our romance is through  (I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you) (I'll never thrill again to somebody new)  Within my heart I know I will never start (To smile again) Until I smile at you  <i>[instrumental]</i>  Within my heart I know I will never start (To smile again) Until I smile at you  <i>[very brief instrumental]</i>  (Until I smile  at  you) 
 Black cats creep across my path until I'm almost mad I must have roused the Devil's wrath 'cause all my luck is bad I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains I try to give a party but the guy upstairs complains I guess I'll go through life just catchin' colds and missin' trains Everything happens to me  I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps I guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps Everything happens to me  At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me That love would turn the trick to end despair  But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me So I've mortgaged all my castles in the air  I've telegraphed and phoned, sent an Air Mail Special, too You answer was "Goodbye", there was even postage due I fell in love just once and then it had to be with you Everything happens to me  I've never drawn a sweepstake or a bank night at a show I thought perhaps this time I'd won but Lady Luck said "No" And though it breaks my heart I'm not surprised to see you go Everything happens to me  Everything happens to me 
 In the blue of evening when you appear close to me, dear one, There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie, In the blue of evening while crickets call and stars are falling, There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me. In the shadows of the night we'll stand, I'll touch your hand. And then, softly as your lovely eyes entreat, our lips will meet again. In the blue of evening, night winds above whisper I love you, There will we find romance in the blue of evening. 
 I'm not the guy who cared about love And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such I never cared much Oh, look at me now!

 You'd be so nice to come home to You'd be so nice by the fire While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby You'd be all my heart could desire  Under stars chilled by the winter Under an August moon shining above You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise To come home to and love  Under stars chilled by the winter Under an August moon burning above You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise To come home to and love 
 All or nothin' at all Half a love never appealed to me If your heart, it never could yield to me Then I'd rather, rather have nothin' at all  I said all, nothin' at all If it's love, there ain't no in-between Why begin then cry for somethin' that might have been No I'd rather, rather have nothin' at all  Hey, please don't bring your lips close to my cheek Don't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak And my heart, it may grow very dizzy and fall  And if I fell under the spell of your call I would be, be caught in the undertow Well, you see, I've got to say "No,  no,  no" All or nothin' at all  <i>[instrumental]</i>  And if I fell, fell under the spell of your call Don't you know I would be caught in the undertow?

 Whenever it's early twilight, I watch till a star breaks through Funny, it's not a star I see, it's always you. Whenever I roam through roses, and lately I often do Funny, it's not a rose I touch, it's always you If a breeze, caresses me, it's really you strolling by If I hear a melody, it's merely the way you sigh Wherever you are you're near me, you dare me to be untrue Funny, each time I fall in love, it's always you 
 How are ya' fixed for moonlight? How are ya' fixed for stars? How are ya' fixed for kissin'? While we listen to soft guitars?  How are ya' fixed for someone To watch the rain with?

 <i>[instrumental intro-1:43]</i>  A country dance was being held in a garden I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon" Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams All around a pug-nosed dream  The music started and was I the perplexed one I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?" In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream  There were questions in the eyes of other dancers As we floated over the floor There were questions but my heart knew all the answers And perhaps a few things more  Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter I know the meaning of the words "Ever after" And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams When I kiss the pug-nosed dream 
 It happened in Monterey, a long time ago I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips, as red as wine Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine  It happened in Monterey without thinking twice I left her and threw away the key to paradise My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart That I left in old Monterey  Ah, it happened in Monterey, a long time ago I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico Stars, guitars, lips red as wine Broke somebody's heart and I fear that it was mine  It happened in Monterey and without thinking twice I left her and I threw away the key to paradise My indiscreet heart, how it longs for that sweetheart That I left in old Monterey 
 Daybreak, another new day, the mist on the meadow is drifting away, For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now, And flowers break through their blanket of dew, Sunrise, how lovely it seems, to see from my window a sky full of dreams, As the white clouds sail on through the blue, at daybreak I did dream of you. 
 It was winter in Manhattan, falling snow flakes filled the air, The streets were covered with a film of ice, But a little simple magic that I learned about somewhere, Changed the weather all around, just within a thrice. I bought you violets for your furs and it was spring for a while, remember? I bought you violets for your furs and there was April in that December. The snow drifted down and the flowers, and that is where it lay. The snow looked like dew and the blossoms as on a summer day. I bought you violets for your furs and there was blue in the wintry sky, You pinned my violets to your furs and gave a lift to the crowds passing by, You smiled at me so sweetly, since then one thought occurs, That we fell in love completely, the day I bought you violets for your furs. 
 Look to your heart, when there are words to say And never leave your love unspoken. Day by day, we go our thoughtless way, and only when we pray Do we remember those we love. Too late to find a word that's warm and kind, Is more than just a passing token. Speak your love to those who seek your love, Look to your heart, your heart will know what to say, Look to your heart today. 
 Without a song the day would never end Without a song the road would never bend When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend Without a song  That field of corn would never see a plow That field of corn would be deserted now A man is born but he's no good no how Without a song  I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul  I'll never know what makes the rain to fall I'll never know what makes that grass so tall I only know there ain't no love at all Without a song  <i>[instrumental]</i>  I've-a got my trouble and woe and, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul   I'll-a never know what makes that rain to fall I'll never know what makes the grass so tall I only know there ain't no love at all Without a song 
 How little we know How much to discover What chemical forces flow From lover to lover  How little we understand - what touches of that tingle That sudden explosion - when two tingles intermingle  Who cares to define What chemistry this is Who cares with your lips on mine How ignorant bliss is  So long as you kiss me - (and) the world around us shatters How little it matters - how little we know (How little we know, how little we know,...) 
 You're mine, at last you're mine I know it took a long, long time For you to fall in love with me I know, I know, I know, I know  Mine, mmm, after all is said and done I knew that you would be the one It was plain to see Whoa yeah, I know, I know  You played hard to get, hoping I'd forget And go and find me somebody new You played a waiting game, I loved you just the same But you forgot that I could play as well as you  And now you're mine I know, I know, I know, I know You're mine, and now the wedding bells will chime And I'll know you're mine... mmm  I know, I know, I know, I know you're mine I know, I know, I know you're mine

 I really can't stay (But baby it's cold outside) I've got to away (But baby it's cold outside) This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in) So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) My mother will start to worry (Beautiful whats your hurry) My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar) So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry) But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour) The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there) Say what's in this drink (No cabs to be had out there) I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now) To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) I ought to say "No, no, no sir" (Mind if I move in closer?) At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)  I really can't stay (Oh, baby don't hold out) Oh, but it's cold out side  I simply must go (But baby it's cold outside) The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside) Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in) So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm) My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious) My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore) My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious) But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before) I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there) Say lend me a comb (It's up to your knees out there) You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand) But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?) There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow) At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)  I really can't stay (Get over that old out) Baby it's cold outside 
 If I am fancy free And love to wander It's just the Gypsy in my soul  There's something calling me From way out yonder It's just the Gypsy in my soul  I've got to give vent to my emotions I'm only content havin' my way  There is no other life Of which I'm fonder It's just the Gypsy in my soul  No cares No strings My heart has wings  If I am fancy free And I love to wander It's just the Gypsy in my soul  I've got to give vent to my emotions I'm only content havin' my way  There is no other life Of which I'm fonder It's just the Gypsy in my soul  No cares No strings My heart has wings  If I am fancy free And love to wander It's just the Gypsy in my soul  It's just the Gypsy in my soul  Just the Gypsy in my soul 
 I'm discontented With homes that are rented So I have invented My own Darling this place is A lover's oasis Where life's weary chase is Unknown  Far from the cry of the city Where flowers pretty Caress the stream  Cozy to hide in To live side by side in Don't let it abide in My dream  Picture you Upon my knee Just tea for two And two for tea Just me for you And you for me Alone  Nobody near us To see us or hear us No friends or relations On weekend vacations We won't have it known, dear That we own a telephone, dear  Day will break And you'll awake And start to bake A sugar cake For me to take For all the boys to see  We will raise a family A boy for you, a girl for me Can't you see how happy we will be 
 Because of you there's a song in my heart Because of you my romance had its start Because of you the sun will shine The moon and stars will say you're mine Forever and never to part  I only live for your love and your kiss It's paradise to be near you like this Because of you my life is now worthwhile And I can smile Because of you  I only live for your love and your kiss It's paradise to be near you like this Because of you my life is now worthwhile And I can smile Because of you 
 When they begin the beguine It brings back the sound of music so tender It brings back a night of tropical splendour It brings back a memory evergreen  I'm with you once more under the stars And down by the shore an orchestra's playing And even the palms seem to be swaying When they begin the beguine  To live it again is past all endeavour Except when that tune clutches my heart And there we are, swearing to love forever And promising never, never to part  What moments divine, what rapture serene Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted I know but too well what they mean  So don't let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine  Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play Till the stars that were there before return above you Till you whisper to me once more "Darling, I love you!" And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in When they begin the beguine 
 I love you for sentimental reasons I hope you do believe me I'll give you my heart  I love you and you alone were meant for me Please give your loving heart to me And say we'll never part  I think of you every morning Dream of you every night Darling, I'm never lonely Whenever you are in sight  I love you for sentimental reasons I hope you do believe me I've given you my heart  I love you for sentimental reasons I hope you do believe me I've given you my heart 
 The very thought of you And I forget to do The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do I'm living in a kind of daydream I'm happy as a king And foolish though it may seem to me that's everything  The mere idea of you The longing here for you You'll never know how slow the moments go Till I'm near to you I see your face in every flower Your eyes in stars above It's just the thought of you The very thought of you My love  The mere idea of you The longing here for you You never know how slow the moments go Till I'm near to you I see your face in every flower Your eyes in stars above It's just the thought of you The very thought of you My love 
 Oh, come ye  O come ye to Bethlehem Come and behold him  Born the King of angels O come, let us adore him  Christ the Lord  God of God  Light of light Lo, he abhors  Not the virgin's womb Very God  Begotten not created O come, let us adore him  Christ the Lord  Sing, choirs of angels  Sing in exultation Sing, all ye citizens  Of heaven above Glory to God  In the highest  O come  Let us adore him  Christ the Lord  See how the shepards  Summoned to his cradel Leaving their flocks  Draw nigh with lowly fear We too will thither hend  Our joyful footsteps O come, let us adore him  Christ the Lord  Yea, Lord, we greet thee  Born this happy morning Jesus  To thee be glory given Word of the Father  Now in flesh appearing O come  Let us adore him  Christ the Lord

 "I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone, if possible, Jew, Gentile, Black man, White. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress."

The fishes swim while rivers run Thru fields to feast my eyes upon Intoxicated drinking from The loving cup of burning sun In dreams I'll crave familiar taste Of whispered rain on weary face Of kisses sweet and warm embrace Another time another place  And every hour of everyday I'm learning more The more I learn, the less I know about before The less I know, the more I want to look around Digging deep for clues on higher ground...

 I'm losing my religion Thank God I prayed about my decision How odd For the man with the mic To be the man all his life While Christ-like stipes did with REM Rev up the RPMs How do I begin to try to paint this sin, of rules? That divides God's people in two  In the beginning, religion created a mask The reformation helped but soon the patch didn't last I don't tell, you don't ask So we created a lie And for generations, church was where we went to go hide Or we no longer tried Because rules read our relationship was empty inside Leaves you bitter, dry Swift to cut like a razor Swift to call you a traitor Cause you're swift to love Taylor Now we got bad blood with our neighbor  Who's wrong, who's right Every Sunday we're divided Who's black, who's white, C'mon Now the man in the mirror never gets race right He'll never be Christ-like Never receive good pay So your faith never rises above minimum wage So when it's time to save the world You don't know what to say To your brother that you love when he tells you he's gay Do you push him away? Judge him down till he leaves? Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs There's room at the cross for everyone, even me  Well my sins are now clean The loss now redeemed Religion is a prison but truth sets us free Helps us believe That the world we're in now is not the world that will be Terror, famine, disease Millions in poverty Hungry, can't sleep With all of this religion, why these babies can't eat? And if the middle class is gone, how can America see? How can America breathe? When the oxygen is gone from the American dream And these American streets listen close as they speak The next time you think America please include me  Help the ones that are weak All they want is a piece Of the pie that you keep Is that too much to ask of those who lay the concrete? Still laying on concrete Pop, Pop by police See, they the foundation of the nation Not the 2% Not the ones that own the building that the middle class rent Because they make sense  Tell me how do you feel? I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal I fight and do right FDR for real One nation under God God, show us the way The science of opinion God is not a buffet You pick what you want so no God on your plate The preacher isn't God Religion's first mistake Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings Has to die to his flesh everyday like me  One VIP All the other seats in church are free We're just groupies God's the celebrity Before 313 AD Before Constantine Before the council of Nacia Before Romans and Greeks Before Kalvin Alexander, Luther Before let there be Before history To the last century Before the death on the tree Before the fall of man Was a picture of me Now to his heart Right before the last three Words he would speak It is finished  Can you believe? I'm losing my religion Thank God Helping you lose yours, Is my job

 I'm losing my religion Thank God I prayed about my decision How odd For the man with the mic To be the man all his life While Christ-like stipes did with REM Rev up the RPMs How do I begin to try to paint this sin, of rules? That divides God's people in two  In the beginning, religion created a mask The reformation helped but soon the patch didn't last I don't tell, you don't ask So we created a lie And for generations, church was where we went to go hide Or we no longer tried Because rules read our relationship was empty inside Leaves you bitter, dry Swift to cut like a razor Swift to call you a traitor Cause you're swift to love Taylor Now we got bad blood with our neighbor  Who's wrong, who's right Every Sunday we're divided Who's black, who's white, C'mon Now the man in the mirror never gets race right He'll never be Christ-like Never receive good pay So your faith never rises above minimum wage So when it's time to save the world You don't know what to say To your brother that you love when he tells you he's gay Do you push him away? Judge him down till he leaves? Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs There's room at the cross for everyone, even me  Well my sins are now clean The loss now redeemed Religion is a prison but truth sets us free Helps us believe That the world we're in now is not the world that will be Terror, famine, disease Millions in poverty Hungry, can't sleep With all of this religion, why these babies can't eat? And if the middle class is gone, how can America see? How can America breathe? When the oxygen is gone from the American dream And these American streets listen close as they speak The next time you think America please include me  Help the ones that are weak All they want is a piece Of the pie that you keep Is that too much to ask of those who lay the concrete? Still laying on concrete Pop, Pop by police See, they the foundation of the nation Not the 2% Not the ones that own the building that the middle class rent Because they make sense  Tell me how do you feel? I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal I fight and do right FDR for real One nation under God God, show us the way The science of opinion God is not a buffet You pick what you want so no God on your plate The preacher isn't God Religion's first mistake Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings Has to die to his flesh everyday like me  One VIP All the other seats in church are free We're just groupies God's the celebrity Before 313 AD Before Constantine Before the council of Nacia Before Romans and Greeks Before Kalvin Alexander, Luther Before let there be Before history To the last century Before the death on the tree Before the fall of man Was a picture of me Now to his heart Right before the last three Words he would speak It is finished  Can you believe? I'm losing my religion Thank God Helping you lose yours, Is my job
